THE CHALLENGE

DataCorp, a rapidly growing B2B data services company, was struggling with manual reporting processes. Their data analysts spent 40+ hours per month creating executive reports using spreadsheets and SQL queries.

- Self-service analytics tools for business users

THE RESULTS

Efficiency Gains:
- Reporting time reduced from 40 hours/month to 2 hours/month
- Executive dashboards updated in real-time vs weekly
- Ad-hoc analysis time reduced by 75%

Business Impact:
- Faster decision-making with real-time data
- Identified $2M in revenue optimization opportunities
- Reduced customer churn by 15% through predictive analytics
- Platform ROI achieved in 6 months

Client Testimonial:
"The analytics platform has transformed how we run our business. What used to take days now happens instantly. Summit Strategy delivered exceptional value." - Lisa Wang, VP Analytics

WHAT'S NEXT

DataCorp has engaged Summit Strategy for:
- Ongoing platform support ($2K/month)
- Phase 2 expansion (predictive analytics - $150K)
- Strategic advisory services

This project demonstrates Summit Strategy's ability to deliver measurable business outcomes through thoughtful technology implementation.`
