      content: `Hi Demo,

Thank you for the comprehensive proposal. The board reviewed it last week and we're very impressed with your approach to our digital transformation initiative.

A few key points we'd like to discuss:

1. Timeline: Can we accelerate Phase 1 to complete by end of Q1 instead of Q2? We have a board presentation in March and would love to show progress.

2. Budget: The $450K estimate is within our approved range. However, we'd like to understand the breakdown for the cloud migration component.

3. Team: Your proposed team structure looks solid. Will Jennifer Martinez be the lead consultant? We worked with her on the CRM project last year and she was fantastic.

4. Next Steps: Can we schedule a kickoff meeting for the week of December 2nd? I'd like to get the executive team aligned before the holidays.

Looking forward to moving forward with this partnership.

Best regards,
Sarah Chen`

November 25, 2025 at 9:00 AM

ATTENDEES
- Maria Santos (COO, NetLogic)
- Tom Richardson (CTO, NetLogic)
- Demo (Summit Strategy)
- Jennifer Martinez (Summit Strategy)

OBJECTIVES
1. Understand technical complexity of 3-platform integration
2. Identify capability gaps (do we need specialist partner?)
3. Assess cultural fit and decision-making process
4. Determine pursuit strategy: aggressive/partner/pass

KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK
- What are the biggest pain points with current 3-platform setup?
- What's driving the timeline (why now)?
- Who are the key technical stakeholders?
- What does success look like in 18 months?
- Have you evaluated build in-house vs consulting partner?

DECISION FRAMEWORK
- 90%+ confidence in delivery → Pursue aggressively
- 70-90% confidence → Pursue with integration specialist partner
- <70% confidence → Pass professionally, refer to specialist

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
- Lisa Wang referral (strong endorsement)
- Right-sized vs Big 4 (they rejected Accenture for being too expensive)
- Technical depth in integrations and migrations

RISKS TO ASSESS
- Complexity beyond our current max project size (2x larger)
- 18-month commitment (long resource lock)
- Integration middleware expertise gap

STAKES
This could establish us in M&A integration space OR overextend capabilities. Be honest in assessment.`

I wanted to touch base on the final deliverables for our cloud migration project. We're extremely pleased with the progress and the December 15th completion date looks solid - actually, you might even finish a few days early at this pace.

For the final review meeting, please prepare:
- Infrastructure architecture documentation
- Migration runbooks
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Team training materials

The executive team has asked me to pass along their appreciation. The project has come in on time and on budget, which is rare in our experience. We'll definitely be providing a reference and would love to explore future projects together.

Final payment ($85K) will be processed on December 15th as agreed.

Thanks again for all the great work.

Michael Torres
CTO, Vertex Systems`

TechStart deal has been in legal review for 5 days now. David Park said "ready to move forward" on Nov 19 but no contract movement yet.

That's normal for legal but worth a friendly check-in. Don't want it to stall during Thanksgiving week.

Good point. I'll send a gentle "happy to answer any questions" email to keep it top of mind.

Perfect approach. Not pushy, just helpful.`
